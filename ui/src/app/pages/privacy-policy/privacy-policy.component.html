          <section>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>The EOSC Innovation Sandbox serves as a testing and integration environment for various services provided by independent service providers. This platform allows users to access, test, and interact with a range of experimental and production-ready services.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each service available through the sandbox is managed by its respective provider, who remains responsible for the collection, processing, and protection of personal data related to the use of their services. This Privacy Policy acts as an overarching framework and refers users to the specific privacy policies of each service provider.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Scope of this Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to the general operation of the EOSC Innovation Sandbox and does not govern the personal data processing activities of individual services accessible through the platform.
            </p>
            <p>Users should be aware that:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>3. Data Collection by the Sandbox</h2>
            <p>Since the EOSC Innovation Sandbox is publicly accessible and does not require authentication, it does not directly collect any personal data from users.</p>
            <p>The platform may collect anonymised technical and operational data strictly for operational, analytical, and security purposes. This data includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
